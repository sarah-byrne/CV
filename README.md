### Employment History
#### 1996 - present: &nbsp; John Lewis Partnership
Some people are surprised by 23 years in 1 company but anyone who has worked at John Lewis won't be.  I've enjoyed job satisfaction from roles in a variety of technology and business areas and, being a Partner, feel a great sense of ownership, responsibility and pride.  Plus, after 25 years, I'll get a 6 month holiday!

I joined as a trainee programmer on the IT graduate scheme and progressed up to a team lead.  As part of an organisational transition to new ways of working, I'm taking the opportunity to go back to my coding roots by becoming a product engineer, focussing on web development.

* writing a data dictionary to define all business dimensions and measures being reported
