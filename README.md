### Employment History
#### 1996 - present: &nbsp; John Lewis Partnership
Some people are surprised by 23 years in 1 company but anyone who has worked at John Lewis won't be.  I've enjoyed job satisfaction from roles in a variety of technology and business areas and, being a Partner, feel a great sense of ownership, responsibility and pride.  Plus, after 25 years, I'll get a 6 month holiday!

I joined as a trainee programmer on the IT graduate scheme and progressed up to a team lead.  As part of an organisational transition to new ways of working, I'm taking the opportunity to go back to my coding roots by becoming a product engineer, focussing on web development.

##### Project Management & Solution Design
###### OCCO...
Omni Channel Customer Ordering was a large programme of changes to re-platform and align several customer ordering systems, enabling a more consistent experience for customers using a mixture of selling channels (shop, online, telephone, ...) to buy from John Lewis.  I had several roles on this programme, the most significant being lead of the high-level design team, managing the work of business analysts, solution architects and solution designers.   My challenges and achievements on this programme included:
* chair of the design authority group, facilitating a large meeting of people with conflicting needs / opinions to resolve issues
* defining the solution design methodology for large programmes, getting it recognised as a discipline within the department and mentoring solution designers
* solution design across incompatible systems, while minimising customisation of off-the-shelf packages
* balancing the need for input from people with knowledge of various different systems and technologies versus ramping up the team too early, to manage costs
* planning the work of my team to optimise flow of output to downsteam teams with conflicting deadlines
* business modelling of a complex domain using Sparx Enterprise Architect

###### USA...
Prior to the Unified Stock Accounting (USA) project, John Lewis had financial systems and stock systems that told very different stories about our stock and profits.   The project implemented new accounting processing to align the financial with the physical.  It required changes to every system involved in buying, selling or moving stock and completely new information systems.  I was the technical lead for the project.  My role involved:
* technical analysis
* solution design 
* coordination of changes being made by many teams 
* writing a data dictionary to define all business dimensions and measures related to stock, sales and profit
* identifying and creating data sources for all reporting requirements

##### Application development and support
Lead developer responsible for development and operational support of systems used in buying offices and shops to manage John Lewis's product data and order stock from suppliers.   My role involved:
* having a good relationship with business colleagues and understanding their roles
* design of front-end and back-end systems 
* COBOL, DB2, CSP/VAGen, Java, HTML
* mentoring junior developers
* balancing development projects with live support of front-end systems and overnight batch suites.
