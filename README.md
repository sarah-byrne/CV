### Employment History
#### 1996 - present: &nbsp; John Lewis Partnership
Some people are surprised by 23 years in 1 company but anyone who has worked at John Lewis won't be. &nbsp; I've enjoyed job satisfaction from roles in a variety of business and technology areas and, being a Partner, feel a great sense of ownership, responsibility and pride. &nbsp; Plus, after 25 years, I'll get a 6 month holiday!

I joined as a trainee programmer on the IT graduate scheme and progressed up to a team lead. &nbsp; As part of an organisational change to become more agile and deploy Partners to areas that are a differentiator for our business, I'm taking the opportunity to go back to my coding roots by becoming a product engineer, focussing on web development.

#### Project highlights

Learning javascript and react. &nbsp; Attending Makers Academy in 2019.

##### Project Management & Solution Design
###### OCCO...
Omni Channel Customer Ordering (OCCO) was a large programme of changes to re-platform and align several customer ordering systems, enabling a more consistent experience for customers who shop using a mixture of selling channels (shop, online, app, telephone). &nbsp; I had several roles on this programme, the most significant being lead of the high-level design team, managing the work of business analysts, solution architects and solution designers. &nbsp; My challenges and achievements on this programme included:
* chair of the design authority group, facilitating a large meeting of people with conflicting needs / opinions to resolve issues
* defining the solution design methodology for large programmes, getting it recognised as a discipline within the department and mentoring solution designers
* solution design across incompatible systems, while minimising customisation of off-the-shelf packages
* balancing the need for input from people with knowledge of various different systems and technologies versus ramping up the team too early, to manage costs
* planning the work of my team to optimise flow of output to downsteam teams with conflicting deadlines
* re-planning after budget cuts
* business modelling of a complex domain using Sparx Enterprise Architect

###### USA...
Prior to the Unified Stock Accounting (USA) project, John Lewis had financial systems and stock systems that told very different stories about our stock and profits.  &nbsp; The project implemented new accounting processing to align the financial with the physical. &nbsp; It required changes to every system involved in buying, selling or moving stock and completely new information systems. &nbsp; I was the technical lead for the project.  My role involved:
* technical analysis
* solution design 
* coordination of changes being made by many teams 
* writing a data dictionary to define all business dimensions and measures related to stock, sales and profit
* identifying and creating data sources for all reporting requirements

##### Application development and support
Lead developer responsible for development and operational support of systems used in buying offices and shops to manage John Lewis's product data and order stock from suppliers. &nbsp;  My role involved:
* having a good relationship with business colleagues and understanding their roles
* design of front-end and back-end systems 
* COBOL, DB2, CSP/VAGen, Java, HTML
* mentoring junior developers
* balancing development projects with live support of front-end systems and overnight batch suites.


#### Extra responsibilities

##### Tech Trends Radar
After a period of significant growth, the John Lewis IT department now encompasses many teams working in different technology areas and it is harder for people to have an understanding of developments outside of the area they work in. &nbsp; The department was looking for ways to foster a learning culture. &nbsp; I led an initiative to introduce an internal radar to publicise changing trends in the tools, technologies and techniques we use. &nbsp; This gave me experience in:
* putting myself out there as the face of an initiative
* presenting to large groups
* facilitating large workshops to agree the content of each issue of the radar
* learning about technologies I'm not close to
* building momentum and breaking apathy

##### Line management
As part of our matrix-management model, I line-managed people working in different projects from me.

##### Tech Council
I'm a member of John Lewis's tech council, which is a group of people with wide-reaching experience in various development roles who support and inspire teams to deliver the best technological solutions practically possible. &nbsp;  It is not a governance body and aims to nurture rather than create red tape.

##### Tutor
I was a tutor to trainees learning to code in COBOL / DB2 as part of the graduate scheme.

### Education
#### 1993 - 1996: &nbsp; Bristol University
BSc Mathematics (2:1)

### Hobbys
