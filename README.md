### Employment History
#### 1996 - present: &nbsp; John Lewis Partnership
Some people are surprised by 22 years in 1 company but anyone who has worked at John Lewis won't be.  I've enjoyed job satisfaction from roles in a variety of technology and business areas and, being a Partner, have felt a great sense of belonging, ownership, responsibility and pride.  Plus, after 25 years, I'll get a 6 month holiday!
